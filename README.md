# Connect Four! üî¥üü°
## Getting Started
Connect Four is a game that is loved by many and a game that was introduced to us in our childhoods. The objective of the game is to place the token down the board and try to connect four tokens together. I was inspired to make this game because it is a game that my fiancee and I play all the time in order to decide who does the chores for the day. It **does** get competitive.

**Instructions**: Press the green tokens on top of the board to get started!
